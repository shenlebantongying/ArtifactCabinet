# Type system

Ownership (aka _affine_ or _substructural_ type system)

## Easy things that are supposed to be done easily, but in rust you have to do it in a CRAP way without actual benefit since they are so obvious.

+ Compare enum type
  + Most simple way `#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]`
  + Pattern matching
+ Construct a tree
  + `Rc<RefCell<T>>`?
  + `Box<T>`?

# SuckLess libraries
+ Rayon -> data-parallelism
