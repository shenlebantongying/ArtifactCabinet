# The Absolute Essence of ECMAScript

> ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment.

There are multiple implementations of ECMAScript and embedded everywhere, including browsers, Qt/QML, GNOME/GJS ,Acrobat, Java's Nashorn, ActionScript, GNU Guile, and weird places. There has to be some reasons for them to choose javascript rather than "nicer" languages.

So, this is an attempt to learn the absolute essence of ecmascript, presumably the language described in the 1997 version of the standard when Guy Steele was an editor for it.

A lot of the critiques toward javascript are aggressive type convection which is not essential.

+ Lodash -> basically function renaming and reduce performance
