One can think of cases as rows and functions as columns in a table. In a
functional language, the rows are fixed (cases in a datatype declaration) but it
is easy to add new columns (functions). In an object-oriented language, the
columns are fixed (methods in a class declaration) but it is easy to add new
rows (subclasses). We want to make it easy to add either rows or columns.
