\section{Counting}
\begin{fact}{Binomial theorem}{binom}
  \[
  (a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k
  \]
  where $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
\end{fact}

\subsection{The Division or Pigeonhole Principles}

\begin{fact}{Division Principle}{}
  If $n$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes,
  then at lease one box contains $\ceil{\frac{n}{k}}$ or more objects,
  and at lease one box contains $\floor{\frac{n}{k}}$ or fewer objects.
\end{fact}

\begin{exec}
  Pick 6 integers between 0 and 9. Show that 2 of them must add up to 9.
  \tcblower
  All possible ways of adding up to 9 are known:
  $(0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)$

  At lease one pair will contain both number when putting picked 6 numbers into those pairs, because at lease one pair will contains $\ceil{\frac{9}{6}}=2$ objects, thus there must be one box that add up to 9.
\end{exec}

\subsection{Combinatorial Proof}

\begin{fact}{Pascalâ€™s identity}{}
  \[
  \binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1}
  \]
\end{fact}

Also

\[
{n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}
\]

\begin{exec}
  Show that $\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}^2 = {2n \choose n}.$
  \tcblower
  Divide $2n$ in the right side into 2 equal sized parts A and B, where $size(A)=size(B)=n$.

  To choose n objects from 2n, we choose $k$ from A and $n-k$ from B.
  Sum up all possible values of $k$, which is $[0,n]$.

  \[
  {2n \choose n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}{n \choose n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}^2
  \]

  where ${n \choose i} = {n \choose n-k}$.
\end{exec}

\begin{exec}
  Show that $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k(n+1-k)={n+1 \choose 3}$.
  \tcblower
  The right hand side can be interpreted as choosing 3 objects $\{j,k,l\}$ from $\{0,1,...,n,n+1\}$, where $0<=j<k<l<=n+1$.

  Object $j$ has $k$ choices while object $l$ has $n+1-k$ choices. Using the multiplication principle, for any given value of $k$, the total ways of picking $j$ and $l$ is $k(n+1-k)$. Summing them up, we get the left hand side.
  \qed

  Similarly, expression $1+2+3+...+n-1+n$ can be viewed as choosing two objects from both side of $k$ in set $\{0,1,2,3....n-1,n\}$ where $0<k<n, k \in \mathbb{Z}$, and thus $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i={n+1 \choose 2}$.
\end{exec}
