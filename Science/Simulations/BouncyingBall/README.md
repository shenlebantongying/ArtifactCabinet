# The most basic simulation problem.

## Example 1

The ball initially at $\text{pos}$ in velocity $\vec{v}$ per unit time.

Assuming $y=0$ is a perfect elastic ground. Upon touching ground, the ball's velocity reverses direction.

The air friction exits and the ball has a aerodynamic perfect shape. The velocity reduction caused by air friction is the reverse direction of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{r}(v)=-C\times \vec{v}$ where $C$ is some constant smaller than $1$.

This does not happen on Earth, so that $G$ is some negative value (vertical direction downward).

**Goal**: Plot this.
