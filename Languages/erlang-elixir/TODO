# async -> sync
To change the message model to synchronous messaging we need to do the
following steps:
1 Each receive clause will also have to match the process ID of the
requesting sender (in addition to the “original” message, e.g., the word)
2 Each receive clause has to send a response to the sender (instead of, e.g.,
just printing the result)
3 On the sender side, instead of using !, we’ll write a simple function that
sends a request and waits for the response
