# Some summary

Erlang's syntax derived from Prolog and was heavily influenced by smalltalk, CSP and the functional programming.

Concurrent means that tasks can be done in any order without compromising the results

Concurrent tasks do not have to be done in parallel; however, we can run them in parallel without any negative effects.

# TODO

`erl`

`c(module_name)` -> compile a `.erl` file to `.beam` and you can use the module directly
