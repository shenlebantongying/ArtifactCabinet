# Polymorphism

Haskell has excellent support for polymorphic functions
+ Haskell supports parametric polymorphism, where a value may be of any type
+ Haskell also supports ad hoc polymorphism, where a value may be one of a set of types that support a particular group of operations

TODO adhoc polymorphism in ocaml?
