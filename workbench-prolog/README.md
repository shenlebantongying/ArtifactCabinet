# Prolog

## Summary

+ Prolog is a language that is useful for doing symbolic and logic-based computation.
+ It‟s declarative: very different from imperative style programming like Java, C++, Python,…
+ A program is partly like a database but much more powerful since we can also have general
rules to infer new facts!
+ A Prolog interpreter can follow these facts/rules and answer queries by sophisticated search

## Difference between `fact` and `rule`:

A rule is a general statement about objects and their relationships.

A rule is all facts that follow same pattern.

Instead of 

```prolog
likes(wallace, gromit).
likes(wallace, tom).
....
```
one can imply wallace like everyone by
```prolog
likes(wallace,X) :- true.
```
Or `Wallace is friend to anyone who love cheese`

```prolog
friend(wallace,X) :- likes(X,cheese).
```

+ prolog box model
+ list representation
