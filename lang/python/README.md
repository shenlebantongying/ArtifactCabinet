# Review Python to use it like a BOSS

# Personal Biased Pkg Collection
### Suckless!
> Reliable, Elegant, Efficient, Bloat-free and Comprehensible
+ Pint -> units
+ Pybtex -> bibtex automation
+ scikit-learn
+ Pillow
+ Jinja
+ Pygments -> syntax highlighter
+ Requests
+ Sphinx

### Partially suck, but useful
+ SciPy/Numpy/Pandas -> Looks bad compared to Julia, as python wasn't designed around Science.
+ PyYAML -> YAML is a terrible format, and every YAML parser is slightly different.
+ Matplotlib -> Copying bad API from Matlab 
+ Colorama
  
### Crap, Blocklist
+ pyca/cryptography -> Author is Rust-fanatic and doesn't care about compatibility!
+ pydot -> useless wrapper
+ PyQt/PySide/PyGObject
+ Django
+ Pelican -> Completely unusable
### To be evaluated
