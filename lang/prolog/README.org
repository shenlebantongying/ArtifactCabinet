* Prolog

** Summary

- Prolog is a language that is useful for doing symbolic and logic-based
  computation.
- It's declarative: very different from imperative style programming
  like Java, C++, Python,...
- A program is partly like a database but much more powerful since we
  can also have general rules to infer new facts!
- A Prolog interpreter can follow these facts/rules and answer queries
  by sophisticated search
