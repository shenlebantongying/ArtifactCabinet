# Swing, Swing, Swing
> TODO
> + Review Java Annotations, reflections

Swing, a goddamned old UI toolkit, is still being used, at least on Jetbrains' IDEs which I love very much. The API is solidified and polished over the years. Swing must be something special to survive for such a long time and showing no sign of deprecating anytime soon.

## Rantings
+ Don't touch `Gradle`, which change its api from year to year (just like the freaking GTK), and it's a super bloat (costing same RAM as a full-fledged IDE).
+ Don't touch `JavaFX`, which is as dead as Flash and Silverlight. Electron has already replaced all rich Internet applications bullshits.

# Tedious Technical Notes

## e.v.

Intellij -> windows keymap

## best practices

GroupLayout -> the best practice.
