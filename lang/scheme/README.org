Dont't use =scheme= layer of spacemacs or =geiser=, they are kind of
overhead. Vallina scheme mode + paredit = nice.

- chez -> r6rs only
- chicken -> r5rs and use SRFI as extension, plus new r7rs and has
  built-in package manager to pull eggs
- guile -> mixture of everything -> GNU-os-api, r5rs, r6rs, r7rs, SRFI
  plus some inspiration from lisp

- MIT scheme -> the one
- Gambit -> high performance, and actively maintained
- Gerbil [[https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil]]
- Chibi -> minimum C
- S7 Scheme -> also minimum C
- Gauche https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html (their doc is
  nice)

It is another type of parallel execution by limiting how long a proc can do, but how can it be implemented in other languages?

What does it do?
-> Set a time limit for a unit of operations, and let the unit run in a separate thread.
-> If the time limit is reached, the unit will be paused.
!!-> AND, it may be resumed with another time limit.

** TODO What does concurrent-ML provides?
