# Technical Notes

Each Lisp implementations have their very own "extensions". Portability can be achieved by avoid using them, but it may be exhausting. 

Let's mainly use `SBCL` and possibly another actively developing one.

If someday `Lispwork` lower their price for personal use........

For windows, just use the [`Portacle`](https://portacle.github.io/) to avoid all the troublesome.
